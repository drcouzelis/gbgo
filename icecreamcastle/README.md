# icecreamcastle.gb

A conversion of my game [Ice Cream Castle](https://github.com/drcouzelis/pico-8), originally for the PICO-8, to the Game Boy.

The source for this project started from the "Hello World" tutorial from ISSOtm's [GB ASM tutorial](https://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial/hello-world.html).

The "hardware.inc" reference file is from [the gbdev community](https://github.com/gbdev/hardware.inc).

Some macros and other ideas are from the work of [mdsteele](https://github.com/mdsteele/big2small).
