Notes
* Do not disable the screen with every frame, it literally turn off the screen and leaves a "white" frame.
* Use the V-Blank interrupt for timing the main game loop.
* OAM must be cleared before use. It is filled with garbage at boot.
* DMA is a process that allows fast transfer of graphics from ROM to OAM without needing to use the CPU. It isn't needed but it's useful.
* It is custom to read the key input and arrange them in a byte, high-to-low, in this order: Down, Up, Left, Right, Start, Select, B, A.
* It is custom to clear the reading of input, although it may not be needed. (load P1F_GET_NONE into [rP1])

Conventions
* Labels use PascalCase
* Labels in VRAM, SRAM, WRAM, HRAM use PascalCase with a v/s/w/h prefix
* Local labels use .camelCase
* Macro names use snake_case
* Constants use CAPS_SNAKE
* Constants posing as labels should look like a label
